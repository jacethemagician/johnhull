Chapter 1 Introduction

Short Concept Questions

1.1. What is a derivative?
A: A derivative involves two parties agreeing to a future transaction. Its value derives from the values of other underlying variables.

1.2. Explain the two main ways that derivatives trade?
A: Over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded.

1.3. What are the changes that have taken place in the regulation of the OTC market since the
2008 financial crisis?
A: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  improves the transparency of OTC markets and reduce systemic risk.
1. Standardized OTC derivatives must be traded on SEFs.
2. Requirement that a CCP must be used for clearing.
3. All trades must be reported to a central repository.

1.4. Which is bigger, the exchange-traded market or the OTC market?
A: The OTC market is bigger.

1.5. What is the difference between a long forward position and a short forward position?
A: Long postions are what buyers are in. Short positions are what sellers are in.

1.6. How do (a) forward and (b) futures contracts trade?
A: Forward contracts are traded OTC. Futures contracts are traded on exchanges.

1.7. What is the difference between a forward contract to buy an asset at $30 and a call
option to buy the same asset for $30?
A: The payoffs are different. A forward contract payoff curve is simple linear of S_t - K. 
A call option payoff curve is a piecewise linear of max(S_t - K, 0). The forward contract is obligation to buy, the call option is the right to buy.

1.8. Explain carefully the difference between hedging, speculation, and arbitrage.
A: Hedging is to reduce risk. Speculation is to take a view/bet on the future direction of the market. Arbitrage is to make a riskless profit from the difference between two or more markets.

1.9. Explain the meaning of bid and ask quotes.
A: The bid price is the price at which the market maker is willing to buy the asset. The ask price is the price at which the market maker is willing to sell the asset.

1.10. What gave rise to Jerome Kerviel’s big loss?
A: He was supposed to be arbitrageur but he was actually speculating and lied to the firm.

1.29. In the 1980s, Bankers Trust developed index currency option notes (ICONs). These were
bonds in which the amount received by the holder at maturity varied with a foreign
exchange rate. One example was its trade with the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. The
ICON specified that if the yen/USD exchange rate, ST, is greater than 169 yen per dollar
at maturity (in 1995), the holder of the bond receives $1,000. If it is less than 169 yen per
dollar, the amount received by the holder of the bond is 1000 - max[0, 1000(169/S_T - 1)].
When the exchange rate is below 84.5, nothing is received by the holder at maturity. Show
that this ICON is a combination of a regular bond and two options.

this statement.
1.35. On May 21, 2020, as indicated in Table 1.2, the spot ask price of Apple stock is $316.50
and the ask price of a call option with a strike price of $320 and a maturity date of
September is $21.70. A trader is considering two alternatives: buy 100 shares of the stock
and buy 100 September call options. For each alternative, what is (a) the upfront cost,
(b) the total gain if the stock price in September is $400, and (c) the total loss if the stock
price in September is $300. Assume that the option is not exercised before September and

maturity date. Describe the trader’s position.
1.41. The price of gold is currently $1,200 per ounce. The forward price for delivery in 1 year is
$1,300 per ounce. An arbitrageur can borrow money at 3% per annum. What should the
arbitrageur do? Assume that the cost of storing gold is zero and that gold provides no
income.

price is about $316 and a December put option with a strike price of $290 costs $21.30.
The investor is comparing two alternatives to limit downside risk. The first involves
buying one December put option contract with a strike price of $290. The second involves
instructing a broker to sell the 100 shares as soon as Apple’s price reaches $290. Discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of the two strategies.
1.43. A bond issued by Standard Oil some time ago worked as follows. The holder received no
interest. At the bond’s maturity the company promised to pay $1,000 plus an additional
amount based on the price of oil at that time. The additional amount was equal to the
product of 170 and the excess (if any) of the price of a barrel of oil at maturity over $25.
The maximum additional amount paid was $2,550 (which corresponds to a price of $40
per barrel). Show that the bond is a combination of a regular bond, a long position in call
options on oil with a strike price of $25, and a short position in call options on oil with a
strike price of $40.
1.44. Suppose that in the situation of Table 1.1 a corporate treasurer said: “I will have
£1 million to sell in 6 months. If the exchange rate is less than 1.19, I want you to give

and 1.25, I will sell the sterling for the exchange rate.” How could you use options to
satisfy the treasurer?
